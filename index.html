            <h1>Brenda C. Martinez</h1>
            <p>Brenda Martinez is a UX Designer based in New Jersey. Over the years of working in technology, she
                realized her favorite part of the work she did was helping users navigate through hard to use systems.
                By creating user manuals and SharePoint sites with the user in mind, she was able to increase user
                satisfaction and reduce questions by frustrated users. Skilled in user research, prototyping,
                wireframing, information architecture, and more, she looks forward to tackling your next design
                challenge.</p>

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>I like to research the topic and organize findings in Figjam to create a proto persona. In order to
                    stay focused and on schedule, I create a research plan to outline my goals and research questions.
                    For qualitative data, I conduct 1-1 interviews while documenting answers on  a spreadsheet. My
                    qualitative data approach is using Google forms to create surveys that I can later export to Google
                    Sheets.</p>

                <h3>User Empathy</h3>
                <p>I try to understand the user by always asking why. Why do they feel a certain way or why they choose
                    to navigate through a task a certain way. Organizing these answers in an affinity map and user
                    persona help maintain the focus on the user. </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
                <p>My approach to qualitative interviews is to keep participants engaged. If I realize we share
                    something in common, I make it known so they’re aware I can empathize. The more comfortable they
                    are, the more they’ll open up and provide the information we’re looking for.</p>
